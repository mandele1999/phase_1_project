**Author:** Mandele Frank

## Overview
This project is intended to help Microsoft make informed decisions on the type of movies to create in the new movie studio they wish to launch. It presents an Exploratory Data Analysis on data availed in various datasets on films, supplemented by visualizations that we can make inferences from.

## Business Problem
Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they don’t know anything about creating movies. You are charged with exploring what types of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the head of Microsoft's new movie studio can use to help decide what type of films to create.


## Data
To solve this business problem, the project features data on genres, budgets, runtime minutes, studios and ratings data that is collected from sources: IMDB, The Numbers, and Box Office Mojo

The data is then filtered to get the information needed by dropping of irrelevant data, handling of missing data using ffill, bfill and modal value techniques,renaming of data names, and dropping of duplicates in preparation for analysis.

## Methods
Analysis on this data includes the use of descriptive statistics and visualization techniques including: bar charts, heatmaps, density plots, scatter plots, and histograms to help identify trends and patterns of films in Box office performance.

Some data required merging of dataframes to help in feature understanding and come up with different features in the dataset.

## Results
The results of the analysis will provide insights into what types of films are currently doing well at the box office. For example, the analysis reveal that Adventure, Drama, Sci-Fi tend to perform better than others and generally higher budget spending positively correlation to better performance in the box office. 

## Recommendations
Based on the results of the analysis, recommendations can be made to the head of Microsoft’s new movie studio on what types of films to create. For example, the analysis reveals that action-adventure films tend to perform well at the box office, it may be recommended that Microsoft focus on producing films in this genre
